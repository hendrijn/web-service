    <ol>
        <li>My service manages a restaurant ordering system, not a to-do list.</li>
        <li>My service uses MySql to manage the database with one table to store all the orders.</li>
        <li>My service uses Express to interact with the database.</li>
        <li>My service is available at https://project2.jacquelyn-hendricks.me:8443/</li>
        <li>The endpoint URL's all have appropriate parameters that relate to the orders database.</li>
        <li>My service receives JSON data in the endpoints and sends JSON data as a response.</li>
        <li>My service can add orders to the system, get all orders, get an order by name, update the name of an order, delete all orders, and delete an order by name.</li>
        <li>I used ufw to block all ports but the one for SSH and the server. (80, 8443, 443 are allowed).</li>
        <li>I used a Nginx server to allow encrypted access to the service.</li>
        <li>My service supports cross-origin resource sharing by including middleware and the options wildcard endpoint.</li>
        <li>My service uses pm2 to keep the service running even when I am logged out of the droplet.</li>
        <li>My service is stored in the GitHub repository "web-service" and is shared with Dr. Johnson on Slack.</li>
        <li>The create_project2.sql and schema.sql scripts are in the repository. The credentials.json file is not included in the repository.</li>
        <li>My GitHub repository has a steady flow of commits.</li>
        <li>The service sends the html page for this report when the user visits https://project2.jacquelyn-hendricks.me:8443/report.html</li>
